Starting a new journey at this new world
Hello all!

With the changes in this world, I decided to take my life further and follow paths that I previously thought were impossible. Now I know that nothing is impossible, and the limit is just a little further from where we are. That is why I am here, to take the steps that will take me to the levels I desire. And to each one I discover: "Even the sky is not the limit!"

Coding in Python, PHP, Java Script, HTML, Css and VUe!
